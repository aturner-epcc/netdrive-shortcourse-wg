# NetDRIVE Short Course Working Group Project Brief

## Project definition

### Background

NetDRIVE would like to develop an initial set of short course training materials 
to enable researchers to take action on improving emissions efficiency and reducing
emissions from DRI use. UKRI have some short term funding available to support the
production of multimedia to support such courses.

A small working group has been formed from willing volunteers, NetDRIVE Community
Champions and other NetDRIVE personnel to design and implement an initial set of 
such courses.

Initial members:

- Adrian Friday (Lancaster University)
- Kirsty Pringle (SSI)
- Liz Ing-Simmons (KCL)
- Lorna Smith (EPCC)
- Andy Turner (EPCC)

People to be kept informed of progress:

- Martin Farley (UKRI)

### Objectives

Aim for 3-5 SMART objectives

1. Produce initial set of learner profiles
2. Propose 2-4 short courses and course objectives

4. Produce a minimum of 2 initial short courses
