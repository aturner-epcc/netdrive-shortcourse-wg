# NetDRIVE Short Course Working Group Project Brief

## Project definition

### Background

NetDRIVE would like to develop an initial set of short course training materials 
to enable researchers to take action on improving emissions efficiency and reducing
emissions from DRI use. UKRI have some short term funding available to support the
production of multimedia to support such courses.

A small working group has been formed from willing volunteers, NetDRIVE Community
Champions and other NetDRIVE personnel to design and implement an initial set of 
such courses.

Initial members:

- Kirsty Pringle (SSI)
- Liz Ing-Simmons (KCL)
- Lorna Smith (EPCC)
- Andy Turner (EPCC)

People to be kept informed of progress:

- Martin Farley (UKRI)
- Adrian Friday (Lancaster University)

### Objectives

Aim for 3-5 SMART objectives

1. Produce initial set of learner profiles
2. Propose 2-4 short courses and course objectives
3. Design short course delivery format (e.g. BBC Bitesize)
4. Produce a minimum of 2 initial short courses

### Scope

- Focussed on emissions - other environmental impacts out of scope for initial materials
- Short format (approx. 20 mins self-study + optional follow on group reflection event)
- Online delivery

### Exclusions, constraints, assumptions

- No direct funding from NetDRIVE to support this
- UKRI have funding for content/platform development if required - deadline of Dec 2025 for applications to this
- Assume NetDRIVE Champions can use funded effort to support this work

## Benefits and risks

### Benefits to customers

- Improved DRI sustainability - reduced emissions
- Can be accessed anywhere without need to travel for training
- Open-source material can be built on and reused

### Benefits to NetDRIVE

- Tangible output 
- Material can be re-used in a variety of ways
- Vehicle for engaging and forming collaboration between Champions and other NetDRIVE people

### Risks

- Likelihood: (5) highly likely - (1) highly unlikely
- Impact: (5) very high impact - (1) very low impact

| Risk | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Treat/Accept? | Treatment Plan/Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Low effort | Low effort leads to no or poor quality material produced | 3 | 5 |   |   |
| Miss UKRI deadline | Do not meet UKRI funding deadline for support to develop materials | 3 | 3 | Accept | Will find other routes or approaches if deadline is missed |

## Products

| Name | Responsible | Due Date | Description | Notes |

Notes transcribed from the whiteboard

**Course format and delivery:**

- Online, self-service
- Maybe BBC Bitesize format?
   + 10-20 min chunks
   + Text online
   + Videos/podcasts embedded/linked
   + Online multiple choice tests to check understanding
   + Links to further and more detailed information
- Could also include group reflective exercises
   + If enough people in one location, they could come together to complete training and then reflect
   + If not enough people, we could run online sessions following training for group exercise
   + Reflect on: how can I implement this in my work? What issues has it raised? 
- Focus on simple maintainability and updatability 

**Target audience:**

- Researchers using DRI:
   + Research group leaders
   + Postdoctoral researchers
   + Postgraduate researchers

**Ideas for topics:**

- Must be practical rather than abstract
- Awareness/assessment of size of carbon emissions 
- Ideas to challenge your supervisor with
- Your place in the system - make sure there is context about organisations responsibilities to change vs individual action
- Relationship between action and activism
- Where to find more information
- Communities to get support - talking and acting on this can feel lonely and you get a lot of push back
- Trusted sources of information - why trust this material?

**Ideas for follow-on or reflective material:**

- GreenDiSC application
- Apply for research culture funds (England)
- Activism (of lots of different types)
- Joining communities
- Reflect on how what you have learned applies in your work
- Reflect on what feelings, questions or ideas it has raised for you
- Reflect on what your next steps might be
